Despite the significant potential of AI-generated videos to transform the tourism industry, there has been limited exploration of their impact in both practical and academic contexts. This paper addresses this gap by applying topic modeling and thematic analysis to social media comments and survey responses. This study proposes a conceptual framework for AI-generated tourism destination videos, identifying 17 themes. The findings highlight key differences compared to human-generated tourism videos, particularly in terms of authenticity and trustworthiness. This paper also contributes to the literature on tourism videos by presenting a pioneering study of AIGC. Furthermore, this research offers practical insights for tourism marketers seeking to effectively integrate AIGC into their marketing strategies. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","AI-generated content; AI-generated video; Generative AI; Thematic analysis; Topic modeling","artificial intelligence; conceptual framework; marketing; social media; tourism market; tourist behavior; tourist destination","","","","","Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU; University of Surrey; School of Hotel and Tourism Management; Hospitality and Tourism Research Centre, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HTRC, (4-ZZU3); Hospitality and Tourism Research Centre, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HTRC","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the support of the Research Training Support Grant from the University of Surrey.

This study examines how the presence of hosts in private and public spaces within promotional materials affects booking intentions for P2P accommodations. Grounded in human territoriality and psychological ownership theories, two experiments were conducted to examine how host visibility in different spaces influences guest perceptions of privacy, trust, and purchase intentions. The results reveal that host presence in private spaces negatively affects purchase intentions due to perceived privacy invasion, while host presence in public spaces enhances trust and booking intentions. Additionally, the effects differ depending on whether guests are booking for themselves or on behalf of others. This research advances the understanding of spatial dynamics in P2P accommodations and offers practical insights for optimizing video marketing strategies. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Human territoriality;

The conditions and mechanisms under which they enhance effectiveness and drive visit intentions remain unclear. This research investigates how presentation speed and activity type in tourism video advertisements interact to influence tourist responses. Through four studies, including secondary data analysis and controlled experiments, the results reveal a significant interaction effect between video speed and activity type. Specifically, for relaxing activities, slow-paced presentations are more effective in boosting visit intentions than fast-paced ones, with this effect mediated by peacefulness. In contrast, for challenging activities, fast-paced presentations are more effective in driving visit intentions, with excitement serving as the mediating factor. These findings contribute to the literature on tourism video marketing, speed marketing research, and positive emotions at varying arousal levels, offering practical guidance for marketers to create more impactful and targeted tourism video advertisements. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Arousal; Excitement; Peacefulness; Presentation speed; Tourism activity type","advertising; marketing; research work; tourism economics; tourism management; tourism market; tourist attraction; tourist behavior; tourist destination; videography","","","","","Education Department of Hunan Province, (24A0032); Education Department of Hunan Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72174213, 72202061); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (24ZDAJ021); Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2024JJ3034); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72174213; 72202061), and Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2024JJ3034); Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 24ZDAJ021 ); Education Department of Hunan Province (No. 24A0032 ).

However, the precise impact of visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, and olfactory cues in multimodal content on consumers’ perceived review usefulness remains unclear. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring how text and image contents affect review usefulness from a multisensory perspective. To this end, we proposed a framework that combined machine learning and multimodal large language models to quantify the multisensory elements conveyed through review text and images. Based on the Poisson regression model, the estimation results show that while multisensory elements in text and images have a generally consistent impact on consumer perception, each sensory element carries distinct value. Furthermore, the sensory discrepancy in text and images has a negative effect on the perceived review usefulness. Our findings contribute theoretically to enhancing review persuasion effect and sensory marketing literature. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Machine learning; Multimodal online reviews; Multisensory elements; Review usefulness; Sensory discrepancy","consumption behavior; information and communication technology; Internet; literature review; machine learning; marketing; perception; precision; tourism market; visualization","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for Xi'an Jiaotong University, (SK2025033); Hong Kong Polytechnic University Departmental General Research Fund, (G-UAPF); National Key R&D Program for Young Scientists, (2022YFF0903000)","The authors acknowledge the support of research funds from the Fundamental Research Funds for Xi'an Jiaotong University (Humanities and Social Sciences) Free Exploration Student Project (No. SK2025033), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Departmental General Research Fund (No. G-UAPF) and the National Key R&D Program for Young Scientists (No. 2022YFF0903000).","Agapito D., Mendes J., Valle P., Exploring the conceptualization of the sensory dimension of tourist experiences, Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, 2, 2, pp. 62-73, (2013); Agapito D., Valle P., Mendes J., The sensory dimension of tourist experiences: Capturing meaningful sensory-informed themes in Southwest Portugal, Tourism Management, 42, pp. 224-237, (2014); Ahtola O.T., Hedonic and utilitarian aspects of consumer behavior: An attitudinal perspective, Advances in Consumer Research, 12, 1, pp. 7-10, (1985); Ali E.H.M., Ahmed M.O., Sensory marketing and its effect on hotel market-share: Perception of hotel customers, Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Management, 7, 1, pp. 116-126, (2019); Alyahya M., McLean G., Examining tourism customers' attitudes and the role of sensory information in virtual reality experiences of a tourist destination, Journal of Travel Research, 61, 7, pp. 1666-1681, (2022); An Q., Ma Y., Du Q., Xiang Z., Fan W., Role of user-generated photos in online hotel reviews: An analytical approach, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 45, pp. 633-640, (2020); Andersson J.E., Usefulness in architecture accessibility, inclusion and usability as spatial sensory experiences, Universal design 2014: Three days of creativity and diversity, pp. 356-365, (2014); Anguera-Torrell O., Leon I., Cappai A., Antolin G.S.A.G.S., Do ambient scents in hotel guest rooms affect customers' emotions?, European Journal of Tourism Research, 27, (2021); Archak N., Ghose A., Ipeirotis P.G., Deriving the pricing power of product features by mining customer reviews, Management Science, 57, 8, pp. 1485-1509, (2011); Baddeley A., Working memory: Theories, models, and controversies, Annual Review of Psychology, 63, 1, pp. 1-29, (2012); Barnes S.J., In living color?

In the context of healthcare influencer marketing, this research integrates the theory of consumption values and relationship marketing theory to examine the effects of consumption values on relationship quality (fanaticism), maintenance (stickiness), and development (value co-creation). Drawing on a sample of 1410 followers from India, this study findings exhibit mixed results on the effects of consumption values on relationship maintenance and development. The findings indicate that fanaticism mediates the effects of consumption values on relationship maintenance and development. Further, the results show positive moderating effects of truthful endorsement and negative moderating effects of endorsement overload on the influencer-follower relationships. This study provides valuable implications for influencers to maintain and develop long-term relationships with their followers. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Endorsement overload; Healthcare influencer; Influencer-follower relationships; Relationship marketing theory; Theory of consumption values; Truthful endorsement","India; academic research; health care; marketing","","","","","","","AlFarraj O., Alalwan A.A., Obeidat Z.M., Baabdullah A., Aldmour R., Al-Haddad S., Examining the impact of influencers' credibility dimensions: attractiveness, trustworthiness and expertise on the purchase intention in the aesthetic dermatology industry, Rev.

This study investigates how the visual quality of NFTs and the presence of price information influence consumer perceptions of luxury goods in the metaverse across three experimental studies. Study 1 compared consumer evaluations across three conditions: good-quality NFT, poor-quality NFT, and no NFT. The findings revealed that poor NFT visual quality negatively influenced evaluations of the original product, with perceived authenticity identified as the key underlying mechanism. Study 2 examined whether this negative effect could be mitigated by the presence of price information. The results showed that a poor-quality NFT accompanied by price information resulted in more favorable evaluations of the original bag, regardless of style similarity. Study 3 replicated these findings using a three-condition design (low-price NFT, high-price NFT, and no NFT), demonstrating that the mitigating role of price information. Together, these findings contribute to the emerging digital fashion literature by highlighting the importance of visual quality and price transparency in NFT-based luxury marketing strategies within the metaverse. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Luxury goods; Metaverse; NFT; Perceived authenticity; Price information; Visual quality","marketing; perception; price dynamics","","","","","","","Baek T.H., Kim J., Yoon S., Choi Y.K., Taylor C.R., The COVID‐19 threat and luxury advertising, J.

This research investigates digital human influencers' attractiveness and their roles in destination marketing. Drawing upon meaning transfer theory and dual process theory, we developed a two-path meaning transfer model integrating both affective and cognitive pathways. A mixed-methods design, including qualitative interviews and four quantitative studies, was applied to identify and validate the attractiveness dimensions and test their effects. We identified six dimensions of digital human influencer attractiveness (expressiveness, physical attractiveness, anthropomorphism, interactivity, trendiness, and cultural attractiveness), which shape marketing effectiveness through the two pathways’ sequential mediation. Additionally, the cognitive route of meaning transfer was moderated by the influencer–destination congruence. This research contributes to the literature by integrating distinct paths to elucidate the mechanisms of digital human influencer endorsement. Our findings also provide insightful managerial implications for better utilizing digital human influencers in tourism marketing. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence-powered; Attractiveness; Cultural attractiveness; Destination marketing; Digital human influencers; Dual process; Meaning transfer","artificial intelligence; cognition; cultural relations; marketing; numerical model; theoretical study; tourism market; tourist destination","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72402153); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Support Program, (2024NSFSC1039); Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Support Program; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2024M762262); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","Funding text 1: This work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant Number: 72402153] and the Sichuan Science and Technology Program [Grant Number: 2024NSFSC1039]. ; Funding text 2: This work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant Number: 72402153], the Sichuan Science and Technology Program [Grant Number: 2024NSFSC1039], and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project [Grant Number: 2024M762262].","Alboqami H., Trust me, I'm an influencer!-Causal recipes for customer trust in artificial intelligence influencers in the retail industry, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 72, (2023); Alotaibi S., Shafieizadeh K., Alsumait K., Customers' perceptions toward service robots at restaurants: The moderating role of consumer innovativeness and the mediating role of perceived hedonic benefits, Journal of Quality Assurance in Hospitality & Tourism, pp. 1-23, (2022); Ameen N., Cheah J.H., Ali F., El-Manstrly D., Kulyciute R., Risk, trust, and the roles of human versus virtual influencers, Journal of Travel Research, (2023); Arsenyan J., Mirowska A., Almost human?

Studies 1 and 2 reveal that cultural landscapes featuring locals and natural landscapes featuring tourists generate higher visit intentions. Furthermore, Study 3 identifies the mediating roles of destination authenticity and attractiveness. By applying visual rhetoric theory and Social Identity Theory, this study introduces locals and tourists as critical human elements in travel photographs and investigates their interactive effects with landscape types, contributing to the literature on the topic. This research sheds light on the reasons behind the ongoing debate regarding the impact of human elements in travel photographs. The study highlights the practical importance of strategically incorporating human elements into travel photography to enhance destination marketing effectiveness. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Destination attractiveness; Destination authenticity; Human element; Landscape type; Travel photograph; Visual content","cultural landscape; experimental study; marketing; photograph; photography; tourist attraction; tourist destination","","","","","","","Bakri M., Krisjanous J., Richard J.E., Examining sojourners as visual influencers in vfr (visiting friends and relatives) tourism: A rhetorical analysis of user-generated images, Journal of Travel Research, 62, 8, pp. 1685-1706, (2023); Breitsohl J., Garrod B., Assessing tourists' cognitive, emotional and behavioural reactions to an unethical destination incident, Tourism Management, 54, pp. 209-220, (2016); Campelo A., Aitken R., Gnoth J., Visual rhetoric and ethics in marketing of destinations, Journal of Travel Research, 50, 1, pp. 3-14, (2011); Casteran H., Roederer C., Does authenticity really affect behavior?

We develop a scale to measure consumers’ simulated responses in reality-enhancing technology experiences, resulting in the creation of a 12-item simulated responses scale with two dimensions, simulated satiation (6 items) and simulated immersion (6 items). The analyses revealed that simulated responses is a multidimensional construct, with each dimension considered an independent scale. Consequently, simulated satiation lowers evaluations of augmented reality tools and purchase intent, yet simulated immersion raises both responses. The results reveal how content variety and exposure duration interact with simulated satiation and simulated immersion to influence consumers’ evaluations and decisions. By employing the simulated responses scale, marketing practitioners can assess the effectiveness of their reality-enhancing technology strategies. The goal is to optimize content variety and exposure duration to achieve better outcomes prior to launching a marketing campaign. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Augmented reality; Marketing; Reality-enhancing technology;

Partnering with a German fashion retailer, the data from 7188 customers who completed an online survey assessing their psychological traits alongside multichannel customer data from the retailer's CRM database were analyzed. The study demonstrates that domain-specific traits such as risk attitude, chronic shopping orientation, need for touch, need for interaction, need for cognition, quality consciousness, and price consciousness can be inferred with moderate to high accuracy. A comparative analysis indicates that the predictive models developed in this study outperform those models trained on alternative digital data records. The findings underline the value of leveraging multichannel customer data to accurately predict individual psychological traits, thus enabling more personalized and automated marketing strategies. This study also provides a methodological framework for practitioners and researchers to utilize psychological trait prediction from digital customer data, advancing the capabilities of marketing automation, such as psychological targeting and real-time personalization in commercial settings. © 2025 The Authors","Machine learning; Multichannel customer behavior; Personalization; Predictive modeling; Psychological targeting; Psychological traits","Germany; accuracy assessment; algorithm; marketing; prediction; psychology; real time; retailing","","","","","","","Ailawadi K.L., Neslin S.A., Gedenk K., Pursuing the value-conscious consumer: store brands versus national brand promotions, J.
