Virtual asset marketplaces inadvertently facilitate money laundering operations by functioning as critical entry and exit points for illicit proceeds. While prevailing scholarly discussion emphasizes the suitability of online video games to small-scale laundering operations, this paper challenges that perspective. A three-part argument is formulated which demonstrates the occurrence of large-scale money laundering in the online video gaming ecosystem. Analyzing virtual asset sales on three marketplaces over a 12-month period reveals significant marketplace vulnerabilities which can (and are) exploited by cybercriminals. Employing Bayesian confirmation theory, this paper combines empirical analysis with further corroborating items of evidence to demonstrate the occurrence of large-scale virtual laundering. The results provide scholars, practitioners and regulatory bodies a foundation on which future interdisciplinary research and discussion can build to mitigate cybercrime-related harms inflicted on society. © 2025","Cybercrime; Cyberlaundering; Financial crime; Risk management; Video gaming; Virtual laundering; Virtual worlds","Barium compounds; Bayesian networks; Commerce; Computation theory; Computer crime; Crime; Information systems; Information use; Interactive computer graphics; Laundering; Virtual reality; Cyber-crimes; Cyberlaundering; Financial crime; Large-scales; Online video; Risks management; Video gaming; Video-games; Virtual laundering; Virtual worlds; Bayesian analysis; crime; electronic commerce; information and communication technology; interdisciplinary approach; marketing; parallel economy; research work; risk assessment; technology adoption; theoretical study; virtual reality; Risk management","","","","","University of Tulsa, TU","The authors acknowledge support for this research from The University of Tulsa Cyber Fellows.","Activision blizzard 2022 annual report, (2023); Akartuna E.A., Johnson S.D., Thornton A., Preventing the money laundering and terrorist financing risks of emerging technologies: An international policy Delphi study, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 179, (2022); Anderson T., Schum D., Twining W., Analysis of evidence, (2005); Antepenko C., Rickey S., Hibbets A., Rusk J.-D., Microtransactions and gambling in the video game industry, 2022 KSU conference on cybersecurity education, research and practice, (2022); Bortner R.M., Cyberlaundering: Anonymous digital cash and money laundering, (1996); Cai T., Du L., Xin Y., Chang L.Y.C., Characteristics of cybercrimes: Evidence from Chinese judgment documents, Police Practice and Research, 19, 6, pp. 582-595, (2018); Cassella S.D., Toward a new model of money laundering: Is the “placement, layering, integration” model obsolete?, Journal of Money Laundering Control, 21, 4, pp. 494-497, (2018); Cloward J.G., Abarbanel B.L., In-Game currencies, skin gambling, and the persistent threat of money laundering in video games, UNLV Gaming Law Journal, 10, 1, pp. 105-115, (2020); Banking in video games and virtual worlds, (2024); Cooke D., Marshall A., Money laundering through video games, a criminals' playground, Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation, 50, (2024); Anti-money laundering: Council and Parliament strike deal on stricter rules, (2024); Cox J., How roblox ‘Beamers’ get rich stealing from children, (2022); P2P trading updates (6th April 2024), (2024); Drummond A., Hall L.C., Sauer J.D., Surprisingly high prevalence rates of severe psychological distress among consumers who purchase loot boxes in video games, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022); Electronic arts Form-10K, (2025); Fairfield T., Charman A.E., Social inquiry and bayesian inference: Rethinking qualitative research, (2022); Virtual currencies – Key definitions and potential AML/CFT risks, (2014); Gilmour P.M., Reexamining the anti-money-laundering framework: A legal critique and new approach to combating money laundering, Journal of Financial Crime, 30, 1, pp. 35-47, (2023); Greer N., Rockloff M., Hing N., Browne M., King D.L., Skin gambling contributes to gambling problems and harm after controlling for other forms of traditional gambling, Journal of Gambling Studies, 39, 1, pp. 225-247, (2022); Higgs J., Flowerday S., Towards definitive categories for online video game money laundering, Journal of Money Laundering Control, (2024); Higgs J., Flowerday S., Online video game laundering: A Bayesian trial, AMCIS 2024 Proceedings, (2024); Higgs J., Flowerday S., Detecting cybercrime in online video gaming, Computers & Security, 156, (2025); Holpuch A., Gaming is booming.

This paper addresses this gap by applying topic modeling and thematic analysis to social media comments and survey responses. This study proposes a conceptual framework for AI-generated tourism destination videos, identifying 17 themes. The findings highlight key differences compared to human-generated tourism videos, particularly in terms of authenticity and trustworthiness. This paper also contributes to the literature on tourism videos by presenting a pioneering study of AIGC.

The conditions and mechanisms under which they enhance effectiveness and drive visit intentions remain unclear. This research investigates how presentation speed and activity type in tourism video advertisements interact to influence tourist responses. Through four studies, including secondary data analysis and controlled experiments, the results reveal a significant interaction effect between video speed and activity type. Specifically, for relaxing activities, slow-paced presentations are more effective in boosting visit intentions than fast-paced ones, with this effect mediated by peacefulness. In contrast, for challenging activities, fast-paced presentations are more effective in driving visit intentions, with excitement serving as the mediating factor. These findings contribute to the literature on tourism video marketing, speed marketing research, and positive emotions at varying arousal levels, offering practical guidance for marketers to create more impactful and targeted tourism video advertisements. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Arousal; Excitement; Peacefulness; Presentation speed; Tourism activity type","advertising; marketing; research work; tourism economics; tourism management; tourism market; tourist attraction; tourist behavior; tourist destination; videography","","","","","Education Department of Hunan Province, (24A0032); Education Department of Hunan Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72174213, 72202061); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (24ZDAJ021); Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2024JJ3034); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72174213; 72202061), and Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2024JJ3034); Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 24ZDAJ021 ); Education Department of Hunan Province (No. 24A0032 ).

Coupling mobile positioning data of international travelers in three South Korean cities and extensive points-of-interest (POI) data, this study develops a discrete choice modeling framework to uncover the key factors that shape travelers’ spatial choices. By introducing area-of-interest (AOI), a novel spatial unit that captures the cumulative effects of tourism resources and urban facilities, the study finds that travel distance to and volume of POIs in an AOI, as well as number of prior visits to the AOI during the same journey, are decisive factors with universal influence across the cities. We also identify factors with city-specific effects or varying influence with respect to travelers’ nationalities and lengths of stay, providing insights for customized marketing and management strategies for the destinations. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Discrete choice model; Length of stay; Mobile big data; Nationality; Spatial choice; Travel behavior; Urban tourism","South Korea; discrete choice analysis; international tourism; marketing; spatial analysis; tourism management; tourist destination; travel behavior; urban region","","","","","Research Centre for Digital Transformation of Tourism; Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HKPU, (1-BBFG); Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HKPU","The authors would like to thank the editors and anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

However, the precise impact of visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, and olfactory cues in multimodal content on consumers’ perceived review usefulness remains unclear. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring how text and image contents affect review usefulness from a multisensory perspective. To this end, we proposed a framework that combined machine learning and multimodal large language models to quantify the multisensory elements conveyed through review text and images. Based on the Poisson regression model, the estimation results show that while multisensory elements in text and images have a generally consistent impact on consumer perception, each sensory element carries distinct value. Furthermore, the sensory discrepancy in text and images has a negative effect on the perceived review usefulness. Our findings contribute theoretically to enhancing review persuasion effect and sensory marketing literature. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Machine learning; Multimodal online reviews; Multisensory elements; Review usefulness; Sensory discrepancy","consumption behavior; information and communication technology; Internet; literature review; machine learning; marketing; perception; precision; tourism market; visualization","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for Xi'an Jiaotong University, (SK2025033); Hong Kong Polytechnic University Departmental General Research Fund, (G-UAPF); National Key R&D Program for Young Scientists, (2022YFF0903000)","The authors acknowledge the support of research funds from the Fundamental Research Funds for Xi'an Jiaotong University (Humanities and Social Sciences) Free Exploration Student Project (No. SK2025033), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Departmental General Research Fund (No. G-UAPF) and the National Key R&D Program for Young Scientists (No. 2022YFF0903000).","Agapito D., Mendes J., Valle P., Exploring the conceptualization of the sensory dimension of tourist experiences, Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, 2, 2, pp. 62-73, (2013); Agapito D., Valle P., Mendes J., The sensory dimension of tourist experiences: Capturing meaningful sensory-informed themes in Southwest Portugal, Tourism Management, 42, pp. 224-237, (2014); Ahtola O.T., Hedonic and utilitarian aspects of consumer behavior: An attitudinal perspective, Advances in Consumer Research, 12, 1, pp. 7-10, (1985); Ali E.H.M., Ahmed M.O., Sensory marketing and its effect on hotel market-share: Perception of hotel customers, Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Management, 7, 1, pp. 116-126, (2019); Alyahya M., McLean G., Examining tourism customers' attitudes and the role of sensory information in virtual reality experiences of a tourist destination, Journal of Travel Research, 61, 7, pp. 1666-1681, (2022); An Q., Ma Y., Du Q., Xiang Z., Fan W., Role of user-generated photos in online hotel reviews: An analytical approach, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 45, pp. 633-640, (2020); Andersson J.E., Usefulness in architecture accessibility, inclusion and usability as spatial sensory experiences, Universal design 2014: Three days of creativity and diversity, pp. 356-365, (2014); Anguera-Torrell O., Leon I., Cappai A., Antolin G.S.A.G.S., Do ambient scents in hotel guest rooms affect customers' emotions?, European Journal of Tourism Research, 27, (2021); Archak N., Ghose A., Ipeirotis P.G., Deriving the pricing power of product features by mining customer reviews, Management Science, 57, 8, pp. 1485-1509, (2011); Baddeley A., Working memory: Theories, models, and controversies, Annual Review of Psychology, 63, 1, pp. 1-29, (2012); Barnes S.J., In living color?

In the context of healthcare influencer marketing, this research integrates the theory of consumption values and relationship marketing theory to examine the effects of consumption values on relationship quality (fanaticism), maintenance (stickiness), and development (value co-creation). Drawing on a sample of 1410 followers from India, this study findings exhibit mixed results on the effects of consumption values on relationship maintenance and development. The findings indicate that fanaticism mediates the effects of consumption values on relationship maintenance and development. Further, the results show positive moderating effects of truthful endorsement and negative moderating effects of endorsement overload on the influencer-follower relationships. This study provides valuable implications for influencers to maintain and develop long-term relationships with their followers. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Endorsement overload; Healthcare influencer; Influencer-follower relationships; Relationship marketing theory; Theory of consumption values; Truthful endorsement","India; academic research; health care; marketing","","","","","","","AlFarraj O., Alalwan A.A., Obeidat Z.M., Baabdullah A., Aldmour R., Al-Haddad S., Examining the impact of influencers' credibility dimensions: attractiveness, trustworthiness and expertise on the purchase intention in the aesthetic dermatology industry, Rev.

Box 100081, Beijing, China","In today's cluttered retail environment, some brands employ “paradoxical” marketing—deliberately juxtaposing mismatched elements—to stand out and intrigue consumers. This study investigates whether and how deliberately incongruent brand communication can outperform conventional strategies in eliciting consumer engagement and fostering positive brand attitudes, particularly through heightened novelty and deeper cognitive elaboration. Five experiments (total N = 5887) were conducted across diverse conditions, including immersive virtual-reality simulations, online surveys, and branding workshops, to manipulate congruent versus incongruent marketing stimuli and test our hypotheses. The results showed that careful mismatches significantly increased consumer excitement and brand evaluations by enhancing novelty and elaborative processing. These gains were strongest for individuals with large self–ideal discrepancies or high tolerance for ambiguity and persisted mainly for hedonic products and successful campaigns, reversing for utilitarian goods and failed initiatives. Conceptually, our findings demonstrate that paradoxical branding engages consumers via dual pathways—an affective “surprise” response and deeper analytical processing—linking schema-incongruity theory with the elaboration-likelihood model. Thus, marketers can break through advertising clutter by introducing unexpected contrasts in their campaigns—for example, adding humor to a serious message or forging unlikely partnerships—to capture attention and prolong consumer interest. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Ambiguity tolerance; Consumer brand perceptions; Elaborative processing; Hedonic vs functional products; Marketing campaign outcomes; Novelty perception; Paradoxical brand strategies; Self-ideal discrepancy","advertising; consumption behavior; marketing","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72372010); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202306030188); China Scholarship Council, CSC","This research was supported by The National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 72372010).

This research investigates digital human influencers' attractiveness and their roles in destination marketing. Drawing upon meaning transfer theory and dual process theory, we developed a two-path meaning transfer model integrating both affective and cognitive pathways. A mixed-methods design, including qualitative interviews and four quantitative studies, was applied to identify and validate the attractiveness dimensions and test their effects. We identified six dimensions of digital human influencer attractiveness (expressiveness, physical attractiveness, anthropomorphism, interactivity, trendiness, and cultural attractiveness), which shape marketing effectiveness through the two pathways’ sequential mediation. Additionally, the cognitive route of meaning transfer was moderated by the influencer–destination congruence. This research contributes to the literature by integrating distinct paths to elucidate the mechanisms of digital human influencer endorsement. Our findings also provide insightful managerial implications for better utilizing digital human influencers in tourism marketing. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence-powered; Attractiveness; Cultural attractiveness; Destination marketing; Digital human influencers; Dual process; Meaning transfer","artificial intelligence; cognition; cultural relations; marketing; numerical model; theoretical study; tourism market; tourist destination","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72402153); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Support Program, (2024NSFSC1039); Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Support Program; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2024M762262); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","Funding text 1: This work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant Number: 72402153] and the Sichuan Science and Technology Program [Grant Number: 2024NSFSC1039]. ; Funding text 2: This work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant Number: 72402153], the Sichuan Science and Technology Program [Grant Number: 2024NSFSC1039], and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project [Grant Number: 2024M762262].","Alboqami H., Trust me, I'm an influencer!-Causal recipes for customer trust in artificial intelligence influencers in the retail industry, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 72, (2023); Alotaibi S., Shafieizadeh K., Alsumait K., Customers' perceptions toward service robots at restaurants: The moderating role of consumer innovativeness and the mediating role of perceived hedonic benefits, Journal of Quality Assurance in Hospitality & Tourism, pp. 1-23, (2022); Ameen N., Cheah J.H., Ali F., El-Manstrly D., Kulyciute R., Risk, trust, and the roles of human versus virtual influencers, Journal of Travel Research, (2023); Arsenyan J., Mirowska A., Almost human?

Gender equality discourses are reshaping how consumers respond to sex appeals, particularly on social media. At first glance, content source appears to play an important role in determining responses – with influencer sex appeals fostering positivity, while brand sex appeals tend to trigger backlash. This study employs an exploratory qualitative approach to develop a nuanced understanding of how consumers respond to influencer use of sex appeals (when promoting a brand), compared to brand use of sex appeals (when promoting itself). The findings reveal that influencer use of sex appeals elicits positive responses, underpinned by parasocial relationships. These are seen as personal, authentic, and empowering, improving engagement with influencers and the brands they promote. Conversely, brand use of sex appeals typically evokes negative consumer responses toward brands and featured models. These are seen as commercially motivated, objectifying, and exploitative, often leading to calls for boycott. These findings offer a novel perspective of how content source, gender equality discourses, and parasocial relationships influence consumer responses to the use of sex appeals as a social media marketing tactic. Implications for consumers, marketers, brands, policymakers, and society are discussed. © 2025 The Author(s)","Influencer marketing; Influencers; Objectification; Self-subjectification; Sex appeals; Sexualization; Social media","","","","","","","","Akaka M.A., Schau H.J., The stories you tell: Crafting managerially relevant articles based on qualitative research, Journal of Advertising Research, 63, 2, pp. 185-200, (2023); Anabila P., Tagoe C., Asare S., Consumer perception of sex appeal advertising: A high context cultural perspective, IUP Journal of Marketing Management, 14, 4, pp. 34-55, (2015); Appel G., Grewal L., Hadi R., Stephen A.T., The future of social media in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 1, pp. 79-95, (2020); Are C., Paasonen S., Sex in the shadows of celebrity, Porn Studies, 8, 4, pp. 411-419, (2021); Azemi Y., Ozuem W., How does retargeting work for different gen Z mobile users?

However, existing research has predominantly examined the role of influencer popularity in isolation, neglecting the interdependencies among influencers within a firm's campaign. In contrast, this study categorizes influencers into two groups—macro- and micro-influencers—based on their popularity, and examines the effect of within- and cross-group spillovers on influencers’ conversion performance. Leveraging data from a real marketing campaign comprising 163 promotional videos of 111 influencers over a 38-month period and utilizing a fixed-effects panel data regression, we found that both within- and cross-group spillovers are significant solely among micro-influencers. Based on these findings, we discuss the theoretical implications for advertising planning and managerial implications for marketing managers seeking to optimize their influencer marketing expenditure. © 2025","Advertising effectiveness; Influencer popularity; Spillover","Commerce; Advertizing campaigns; Advertizing effectiveness; Fixed effects; Influencer popularity; Marketing campaign; Panel data; Performance; Social media; Spillover; Spillover effects; Marketing","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF, (72002136, 72272102); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Numbers 72002136 and 72272102 ).
