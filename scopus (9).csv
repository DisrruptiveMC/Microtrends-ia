Virtual asset marketplaces inadvertently facilitate money laundering operations by functioning as critical entry and exit points for illicit proceeds. While prevailing scholarly discussion emphasizes the suitability of online video games to small-scale laundering operations, this paper challenges that perspective. A three-part argument is formulated which demonstrates the occurrence of large-scale money laundering in the online video gaming ecosystem. Analyzing virtual asset sales on three marketplaces over a 12-month period reveals significant marketplace vulnerabilities which can (and are) exploited by cybercriminals. Employing Bayesian confirmation theory, this paper combines empirical analysis with further corroborating items of evidence to demonstrate the occurrence of large-scale virtual laundering. The results provide scholars, practitioners and regulatory bodies a foundation on which future interdisciplinary research and discussion can build to mitigate cybercrime-related harms inflicted on society. © 2025","Cybercrime; Cyberlaundering; Financial crime; Risk management; Video gaming; Virtual laundering; Virtual worlds","Barium compounds; Bayesian networks; Commerce; Computation theory; Computer crime; Crime; Information systems; Information use; Interactive computer graphics; Laundering; Virtual reality; Cyber-crimes; Cyberlaundering; Financial crime; Large-scales; Online video; Risks management; Video gaming; Video-games; Virtual laundering; Virtual worlds; Bayesian analysis; crime; electronic commerce; information and communication technology; interdisciplinary approach; marketing; parallel economy; research work; risk assessment; technology adoption; theoretical study; virtual reality; Risk management","","","","","University of Tulsa, TU","The authors acknowledge support for this research from The University of Tulsa Cyber Fellows.","Activision blizzard 2022 annual report, (2023); Akartuna E.A., Johnson S.D., Thornton A., Preventing the money laundering and terrorist financing risks of emerging technologies: An international policy Delphi study, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 179, (2022); Anderson T., Schum D., Twining W., Analysis of evidence, (2005); Antepenko C., Rickey S., Hibbets A., Rusk J.-D., Microtransactions and gambling in the video game industry, 2022 KSU conference on cybersecurity education, research and practice, (2022); Bortner R.M., Cyberlaundering: Anonymous digital cash and money laundering, (1996); Cai T., Du L., Xin Y., Chang L.Y.C., Characteristics of cybercrimes: Evidence from Chinese judgment documents, Police Practice and Research, 19, 6, pp. 582-595, (2018); Cassella S.D., Toward a new model of money laundering: Is the “placement, layering, integration” model obsolete?, Journal of Money Laundering Control, 21, 4, pp. 494-497, (2018); Cloward J.G., Abarbanel B.L., In-Game currencies, skin gambling, and the persistent threat of money laundering in video games, UNLV Gaming Law Journal, 10, 1, pp. 105-115, (2020); Banking in video games and virtual worlds, (2024); Cooke D., Marshall A., Money laundering through video games, a criminals' playground, Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation, 50, (2024); Anti-money laundering: Council and Parliament strike deal on stricter rules, (2024); Cox J., How roblox ‘Beamers’ get rich stealing from children, (2022); P2P trading updates (6th April 2024), (2024); Drummond A., Hall L.C., Sauer J.D., Surprisingly high prevalence rates of severe psychological distress among consumers who purchase loot boxes in video games, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022); Electronic arts Form-10K, (2025); Fairfield T., Charman A.E., Social inquiry and bayesian inference: Rethinking qualitative research, (2022); Virtual currencies – Key definitions and potential AML/CFT risks, (2014); Gilmour P.M., Reexamining the anti-money-laundering framework: A legal critique and new approach to combating money laundering, Journal of Financial Crime, 30, 1, pp. 35-47, (2023); Greer N., Rockloff M., Hing N., Browne M., King D.L., Skin gambling contributes to gambling problems and harm after controlling for other forms of traditional gambling, Journal of Gambling Studies, 39, 1, pp. 225-247, (2022); Higgs J., Flowerday S., Towards definitive categories for online video game money laundering, Journal of Money Laundering Control, (2024); Higgs J., Flowerday S., Online video game laundering: A Bayesian trial, AMCIS 2024 Proceedings, (2024); Higgs J., Flowerday S., Detecting cybercrime in online video gaming, Computers & Security, 156, (2025); Holpuch A., Gaming is booming.

The conditions and mechanisms under which they enhance effectiveness and drive visit intentions remain unclear. This research investigates how presentation speed and activity type in tourism video advertisements interact to influence tourist responses. Through four studies, including secondary data analysis and controlled experiments, the results reveal a significant interaction effect between video speed and activity type. Specifically, for relaxing activities, slow-paced presentations are more effective in boosting visit intentions than fast-paced ones, with this effect mediated by peacefulness. In contrast, for challenging activities, fast-paced presentations are more effective in driving visit intentions, with excitement serving as the mediating factor. These findings contribute to the literature on tourism video marketing, speed marketing research, and positive emotions at varying arousal levels, offering practical guidance for marketers to create more impactful and targeted tourism video advertisements. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Arousal; Excitement; Peacefulness; Presentation speed; Tourism activity type","advertising; marketing; research work; tourism economics; tourism management; tourism market; tourist attraction; tourist behavior; tourist destination; videography","","","","","Education Department of Hunan Province, (24A0032); Education Department of Hunan Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72174213, 72202061); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (24ZDAJ021); Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2024JJ3034); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72174213; 72202061), and Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2024JJ3034); Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 24ZDAJ021 ); Education Department of Hunan Province (No. 24A0032 ).

As brain-computer interfaces and hybrid intelligence devices enable access to human brains, using electroencephalographic brain data becomes more relevant in future. Contrary to the majority view of previous research, our results show that there is a link between personality traits and brain features of a user. With a four times higher probability of correctly predicting the personality of an independent user compared to naive prediction, we demonstrate the possibility of predicting a user’s personality based on their brain information and thus showing a new reliable approach for marketing purposes in electronic markets. © The Author(s) 2025.","Convolutional neural network; Five-factor model; Machine learning; Personality mining; Predictive analysis; Resting-state electroencephalogram","","","","","","","","Ackerman E., Strickland E., Are you ready for workplace brain scanning?: Leveraging brain data will make workers happier and more productive, backers say, IEEE Spectrum, 59, 12, pp. 46-52, (2022); Agastya I.M.A., Handayani D.O.D., Mantoro T., A systematic literature review of deep learning algorithms for personality trait recognition, 2019 5Th International Conference on Computing Engineering and Design, pp. 1-6, (2019); Ahmed S.F., Alam M.S.B., Hassan M., Rozbu M.R., Ishtiak T., Rafa N., Mofijur M., Shawkat Ali A.B.M., Gandomi A.H., Deep learning modelling techniques: Current progress, applications, advantages, and challenges, Artificial Intelligence Review, 56, pp. 13521-13617, (2023); A mind-brain-body dataset of MRI, EEG, cognition, emotion, and peripheral physiology in young and old adults, Scientific Data, 6, (2019); Barrick M.R., Mount M.K., The big five personality dimensions and job performance: A meta-analysis, Personnel Psychology, 44, 1, pp. 1-26, (1991); Baumgartl H., Bayerlein S., Buettner R., Measuring extraversion using EEG data, Information Systems and Neuroscience: Neurois Retreat 2020, 43, pp. 259-265, (2020); Berger H., Über das Elektrenkephalogramm des Menschen, Archiv für Psychiatrie, 87, pp. 527-570, (1929); Bernal S.L., Celdran A.H., Perez G.M., Barros M.T., Balasubramaniam S., Security in brain-computer interfaces: State-of-the-art, opportunities, and future challenges, ACM Computing Surveys, 54, 1, pp. 1-35, (2021); Bhardwaj H., Tomar P., Sakalle A., Bhardwaj A., Classification of extraversion and introversion personality trait using electroencephalogram signals.

Coupling mobile positioning data of international travelers in three South Korean cities and extensive points-of-interest (POI) data, this study develops a discrete choice modeling framework to uncover the key factors that shape travelers’ spatial choices. By introducing area-of-interest (AOI), a novel spatial unit that captures the cumulative effects of tourism resources and urban facilities, the study finds that travel distance to and volume of POIs in an AOI, as well as number of prior visits to the AOI during the same journey, are decisive factors with universal influence across the cities. We also identify factors with city-specific effects or varying influence with respect to travelers’ nationalities and lengths of stay, providing insights for customized marketing and management strategies for the destinations. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Discrete choice model; Length of stay; Mobile big data; Nationality; Spatial choice; Travel behavior; Urban tourism","South Korea; discrete choice analysis; international tourism; marketing; spatial analysis; tourism management; tourist destination; travel behavior; urban region","","","","","Research Centre for Digital Transformation of Tourism; Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HKPU, (1-BBFG); Hong Kong Polytechnic University, HKPU","The authors would like to thank the editors and anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

However, the precise impact of visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, and olfactory cues in multimodal content on consumers’ perceived review usefulness remains unclear. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring how text and image contents affect review usefulness from a multisensory perspective. To this end, we proposed a framework that combined machine learning and multimodal large language models to quantify the multisensory elements conveyed through review text and images. Based on the Poisson regression model, the estimation results show that while multisensory elements in text and images have a generally consistent impact on consumer perception, each sensory element carries distinct value. Furthermore, the sensory discrepancy in text and images has a negative effect on the perceived review usefulness. Our findings contribute theoretically to enhancing review persuasion effect and sensory marketing literature. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Machine learning; Multimodal online reviews; Multisensory elements; Review usefulness; Sensory discrepancy","consumption behavior; information and communication technology; Internet; literature review; machine learning; marketing; perception; precision; tourism market; visualization","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for Xi'an Jiaotong University, (SK2025033); Hong Kong Polytechnic University Departmental General Research Fund, (G-UAPF); National Key R&D Program for Young Scientists, (2022YFF0903000)","The authors acknowledge the support of research funds from the Fundamental Research Funds for Xi'an Jiaotong University (Humanities and Social Sciences) Free Exploration Student Project (No. SK2025033), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Departmental General Research Fund (No. G-UAPF) and the National Key R&D Program for Young Scientists (No. 2022YFF0903000).","Agapito D., Mendes J., Valle P., Exploring the conceptualization of the sensory dimension of tourist experiences, Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, 2, 2, pp. 62-73, (2013); Agapito D., Valle P., Mendes J., The sensory dimension of tourist experiences: Capturing meaningful sensory-informed themes in Southwest Portugal, Tourism Management, 42, pp. 224-237, (2014); Ahtola O.T., Hedonic and utilitarian aspects of consumer behavior: An attitudinal perspective, Advances in Consumer Research, 12, 1, pp. 7-10, (1985); Ali E.H.M., Ahmed M.O., Sensory marketing and its effect on hotel market-share: Perception of hotel customers, Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Management, 7, 1, pp. 116-126, (2019); Alyahya M., McLean G., Examining tourism customers' attitudes and the role of sensory information in virtual reality experiences of a tourist destination, Journal of Travel Research, 61, 7, pp. 1666-1681, (2022); An Q., Ma Y., Du Q., Xiang Z., Fan W., Role of user-generated photos in online hotel reviews: An analytical approach, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, 45, pp. 633-640, (2020); Andersson J.E., Usefulness in architecture accessibility, inclusion and usability as spatial sensory experiences, Universal design 2014: Three days of creativity and diversity, pp. 356-365, (2014); Anguera-Torrell O., Leon I., Cappai A., Antolin G.S.A.G.S., Do ambient scents in hotel guest rooms affect customers' emotions?, European Journal of Tourism Research, 27, (2021); Archak N., Ghose A., Ipeirotis P.G., Deriving the pricing power of product features by mining customer reviews, Management Science, 57, 8, pp. 1485-1509, (2011); Baddeley A., Working memory: Theories, models, and controversies, Annual Review of Psychology, 63, 1, pp. 1-29, (2012); Barnes S.J., In living color?

While a variety of disciplines are developing new approaches to drive service innovation, this is primarily done in isolation and generates only fragmented solutions. Sociological theory has proposed “boundary objects” as an effective umbrella for communication and cooperation among communities. Therefore, we introduce continuous value shaping (CVS) as a boundary object describing service innovation approaches along five principles. We reflect on this concept through the different disciplinary lenses of researchers in service marketing, information systems, service engineering, sociology of work, and innovation management. These perspectives highlight how the CVS principles already connect to discourses within the individual disciplines. However, the CVS concept will not only provide an umbrella to embrace existing activities in different academic disciplines. It also assists to identify research themes that will benefit from uniting the power of these disciplines, and it can serve as an integrating framework to conceptualize complex service innovation approaches. Thus, the CVS concept should guide both researchers and practitioners to develop and implement novel innovation and transformation efforts—in and across organizations. © The Author(s) 2025.","Continuous value shaping (CVS); Digitalization; Interdisciplinary research; Service innovation; Service research; Sustainability","","","","","","","","Ackerhans S., Huynh T., Kaiser C., Schultz C., Exploring the role of professional identity in the implementation of clinical decision support systems—A narrative review, Implementation Science, 19, 1, (2024); Alvesson M., Spicer A., Neo-institutional theory and organization studies: A mid-life crisis?, Organization Studies, 40, 2, pp. 199-218, (2019); Anderl E., Marz A., Schumann J.H., Nonmonetary customer value contributions in free e-services, Journal of Strategic Marketing, 24, 3-4, pp. 175-189, (2016); Anderson L., Ostrom A.L., Transformative service research: Advancing our knowledge about service and well-being, Journal of Service Research, 18, 3, pp. 243-249, (2015); Anderson L., Ostrom A.L., Corus C., Fisk R.P., Gallan A.S., Giraldo M., Mende M., Mulder M., Rayburn S.W., Rosenbaum M.S., Transformative service research: An agenda for the future, Journal of Business Research, 66, 8, pp. 1203-1210, (2013); Antons D., Breidbach C.F., Big data, big insights?

Drawing on accessibility-diagnosticity theory and on the so-called “top dog effect”, the study examines how decisions to visit types of city destinations are shaped by exposure and comparison. Four studies were undertaken to explore preference asymmetries, competitive mechanisms, and the moderating role of individual traits. It was found that the way slow cities are perceived is significantly influenced by comparison with mega cities and with advertising strategies, which reveal both opportunities and vulnerabilities for target marketing and segmentation. The results provide helpful inputs for destination marketers when embarking on promotion and marketing strategies and product development. © 2025","Competitiveness; Destination; Ebbinghaus illusion; Mega city; Slow city","accessibility; competitiveness; megacity; strategic approach; tourism development; tourist destination; trade-off; vulnerability","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2024S1A5B5A16020658); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea ( NRF-2024S1A5B5A16020658 ).

However, existing research has predominantly examined the role of influencer popularity in isolation, neglecting the interdependencies among influencers within a firm's campaign. In contrast, this study categorizes influencers into two groups—macro- and micro-influencers—based on their popularity, and examines the effect of within- and cross-group spillovers on influencers’ conversion performance. Leveraging data from a real marketing campaign comprising 163 promotional videos of 111 influencers over a 38-month period and utilizing a fixed-effects panel data regression, we found that both within- and cross-group spillovers are significant solely among micro-influencers. Based on these findings, we discuss the theoretical implications for advertising planning and managerial implications for marketing managers seeking to optimize their influencer marketing expenditure. © 2025","Advertising effectiveness; Influencer popularity; Spillover","Commerce; Advertizing campaigns; Advertizing effectiveness; Fixed effects; Influencer popularity; Marketing campaign; Panel data; Performance; Social media; Spillover; Spillover effects; Marketing","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF, (72002136, 72272102); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Numbers 72002136 and 72272102 ).

Through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 424 Scopus-indexed articles dated from 2006 to 2024, this study maps the intellectual and thematic evolution of VBCs research using VOSviewer and SciMAT. The analysis reveals a notable shift from early research focused on technology and online community dynamics to more sophisticated research on digital marketing strategies, consumer behavior patterns, and brand management approaches. Consumer engagement, brand trust, and purchase intention emerge as central themes, with a growing emphasis on user-generated content, electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), and social commerce developments. Findings demonstrate that VBCs not only influence consumer decision-making processes but also function as strategic assets for brands seeking to enhance customer relationships and cultivate long-term loyalty. VBCs increasingly serve as innovation hubs where brands can co-create value with consumers while building authentic connections. The research contributes significantly to understanding VBCs' evolving role in contemporary brand strategy, especially because VBCs represent a crucial frontier where brands can differentiate themselves through meaningful consumer interactions and relationship building beyond traditional marketing approaches. It is important to highlight that, by mapping both historical foundations and emerging trajectories in VBCs studies, this review establishes a baseline for future research directions while providing actionable insights for practitioners. Brands can leverage these findings to develop more effective community management strategies and capitalize on the competitive advantages offered by well-cultivated digital communities. © 2025","Bibliometric analysis; Co-occurrence analysis; Consumer behavior; Digital marketing; Virtual Brand Community","","","","","","","","Ahmed R.R., Zaidi E.Z., Alam S.H., Streimikiene D., Parmar V., Effect of social media marketing of luxury brands on brand equity, customer equity and customer purchase intention, Amfiteatru Economic, 25, 62, (2023); Akdevelioglu D., Hansen S., Venkatesh A., Wearable technologies, brand community and the growth of a transhumanist vision, Journal of Marketing Management, 38, 5-6, pp. 569-604, (2021); Ali F., Suveatwatanakul C., Nanu L., Ali M., Terrah A., Social media marketing and brand loyalty: Exploring interrelationships through symmetrical and asymmetrical modeling, Spanish Journal of Marketing - ESIC., (2025); Allahbakhshian Farsani L., Riahinia N., Danesh F., Azimi A., Co-occurrence analysis of COVID-19 publications with an emphasis on the global health governance (GHG), Advanced Biomedical Research, 13, (2024); de Almeida S.O., Scaraboto D., dos Santos Fleck J.P., Dalmoro M., Seriously engaged consumers: Navigating between work and play in online brand communities, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 44, 1, pp. 29-42, (2018); Anaya-Sanchez R., Aguilar-Illescas R., Molinillo S., Martinez-Lopez F.J., Trust and loyalty in online brand communities, Spanish Journal of Marketing - ESIC, 24, 2, pp. 177-191, (2020); Aoki K., Tudor R.K., Borders A.L., Lester D.H., Why build sustainable relationships with customers? - the effects of “ambassador program.”, Journal of Global Scholars of Marketing Science, 30, 3, pp. 291-303, (2020); Ardley B., McIntosh E., McManus J., From transactions to interactions: The value of co-creation processes within online brand consumer communities, Business Process Management Journal, 26, 4, pp. 825-838, (2020); Arya V., Verma H., Sethi D., Agarwal R., Brand authenticity and brand attachment: How online communities built on social networking vehicles moderate the consumers’ brand attachment, IIM Kozhikode Society & Management Review, 8, 2, pp. 87-103, (2019); Baas J., Schotten M., Plume A., Cote G., Karimi R., Scopus as a curated, high-quality bibliometric data source for academic research in quantitative science studies, Quantitative Science Studies, 1, 1, pp. 377-386, (2020); Baranidharan S., Sharon Sophia J., Mohan C., Does gamification affect customer brand engagement and brand value co-creation?, Advances in marketing, customer relationship management, and E-services, pp. 258-276, (2023); Bilal M., Akram U., Zhang Y., Cai S., Wang Z., Love is blind!

Low-carbon consumption has emerged as a critical component of the low-carbon economy. Carbon labels were introduced to guide consumers toward more sustainable choices. By enhancing access to environmental-friendly information, carbon labeling mitigates the asymmetry of carbon-related information between consumers and manufacturers. Additionally, as a guiding social norm, it contributes to fostering a culture of low-carbon consumption. This study analyzes the impact of carbon labels on consumers’ low-carbon purchasing decisions by categorizing them into numerical and non-numerical types. Utilizing an incremental dual-pronged experimental design, we explore the interplay among consumers’ nature relatedness, the perceived value of carbon labels, trust levels in these labels, preferences for label types, and the willingness to pay a premium for carbon-labeled products. The experimental results indicate that consumers’ environmental attitudes - nature relatedness, significantly influence their willingness to purchase low-carbon products, higher levels of nature relatedness are positively associated with an increased likelihood of selecting carbon-labeled products, especially those featuring numerical carbon labels. Furthermore, the perceived value of carbon labels and the degree of trust in these labels serve as dual mediators between nature relatedness and the willingness to choose and pay a premium for carbon-labeled goods. Interestingly, consumers demonstrate a higher willingness to pay a premium for non-numerical carbon labels compared to numerical ones. These findings offer valuable insights for Chinese enterprises looking to implement marketing strategies based on carbon labeling as they navigate the early stages of the low-carbon economy. © 2025","Carbon label type; Low-carbon consumption; Nature relatedness; Perceived value; Trust","","","","","","","","Portner H.-O., Roberts D.C., Poloczanska E.S., Mintenbeck K., Tignor M., Alegria A., Craig M., Langsdorf S., Loschke S., Moller V., Okem A., Summary for policymakers, Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability.
